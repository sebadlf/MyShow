She found that the package was being transported by train and heavily armed, and the team decided to go undercover to board the train. Skye was paired with Fitz, and the two were responsible for communications. They posed as a young couple on a tour of Europe, Skye stealing the conductor\u0027s keys. She and Fitz set up comms in an unused room and start discussing the package on board. Skye wonders if it could be an 0-8-4, but Fitz says no, since they know the origin of the package is Cybertek. Skye then asks if an 0-8-4 could be a human. With this question, Skye reveals her hope that there might be another alien out there on Earth like her. She might not be alone. Fitz responds by telling her that it is possible, but he\u0027d hate to meet the guy. One of the thugs from Cybertek bursts into the room and the two fight him off, but he detonates a toxin grenade just as Simmons runs in. Simmons is paralyzed along with the thug, and Skye and Fitz leave the train to track down Cybertek and Ian Quinn after they see the thugs handing over the package. It leads them to a large villa and Skye decides to sneak in. She reaches the basement and sees Mike Peterson lying in a hyperbaric chamber, but is caught by Quinn. He takes Mike out of the chamber, fitting him with a prosthetic leg. Sky attempts to reason with Mike, but he doesn\u0027t listen, leaving to complete his orders given by the Clairvoyant. Quinn shoots Skye in the stomach, embraces her as she\u0027s about to fall forward, then shoots her again. He lowers her to the ground slowly, then leaves her to die, saying \u0022I have my orders too\u0022. Skye tries to call for help but is unsuccessful due to the tremendous loss of blood.

As Coulson, Agents Garrett, Ward and Fitz located the serum, Skye\u0027s condition gets worse, causing everyone aboard the Bus to rush to her aid. Ward and Fitz make it back to the Bus with the drug, but Coulson rushes in tells them not to give it to her. Simmons, however, already did and while she worsened for a moment, she soon stabilized. Skye quickly made a rapid recovery, but she was confined to her bed while Simmons performed tests to find out the drugs effects on her. When Lady Sif appeared on Earth and Lorelei had taken control of Ward, Coulson tasked Skye to find them. She did locate them, but they were long gone. When the bus was taken over, Skye and Simmons were locked in by Fitz, but they were released by Coulson. Skye managed to open the hatch in the interrogation room to get Sif back inside.

Given the Clairvoyant supposed psychic abilities, Skye devised a way to divided into teams of two, one agent that knows the coordinates of the target and the other with the information on the target. Receiving praise from Garrett, Skye admits she doesn\u0027t have clearance, but Coulson shocks her by making her a fully-fledged level 1 SHIELD agent.

After realizing Agent Blake shot Deathlok with traceable rounds, Skye located him at horse track, but was sidelined due to her recent injury. She located Peterson through one of Fitz\u0027s drones, but she discovered that Deathlok didn\u0027t just have new weapons and a robotic leg, but he has grafted cybernetics within his body.

The agents did find the Clairvoyant in the basement of the track and he admitted Skye has something they wanted and will kill her to get it, prompting Ward to kill him in cold blood. Skye scolded Ward for what he did, but he tried to defend his actions by reminding her what he has caused over time and he did to protect her and the team. However, Coulson confides in Skye that the man Ward killed could have been a decoy and Skye realized that the person they were talking to had personal knowledge on Coulson and Ward, leading to the conclusion that the real Clairvoyant is a member of SHIELD.
