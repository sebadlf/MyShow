Residents blamed Hannah for the consequent loss of life and serious injuries, a situation exacerbated by the \u0027weird stuff\u0027 that began to happen around her - including the \u0027poltergeist\u0027 attack on a shopkeeper who harassed her, and the driverless car which attempted to run down a mob who were trying to run her out of town. Hannah is shot and sedated by Agent May , in order to defuse the increasingly volatile confrontation. Back on The Bus , the team discover that Hannah believes herself to be suffering a punishment from God, specifically haunting by demons. Numerous strange and dangerous moments seem to back her up, until Jemma Simmons finally encounters the true cause of the disturbances, a worker from the factory, Tobias Ford , who was trapped between dimensions by the explosion. Tobias had a crush on Hannah, and performed what he believed was minor, inconsequential sabotage on his own equipment so that Hannah, as the safety inspector, would have to come and visit.

She was shown to fuss over Leo alot before he went, and made him a sandwich. S kye convinced Jemma to help her hack SHIELD, at great risk to Jemma\u0027s good-girl reputation. While accessing a wall panel, she was confronted by Sitwell , a superior officer. After many lame excuses and failed sweet talking, Jemma panicked and used the Night-Night Gun to shoot Sitwell in the chest. Coulson managed to get Jemma out of any serious trouble, luckily. The team rescued Leo and Grant with perfect timing, and Fitzsimmons were very happy to be reunited. After Leo bragged about how he had Grant\u0027s back, Jemma excitedly told him about how she had shot a superior officer in the chest, only to see his face fall.","elements":[]}],"images":[]},{"id":9881,"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[{"id":14827,"type":"paragraph","text":" Leopold Fitz : Colleague, research partner, best friend (possible love interest)","elements":[]},{"id":14828,"type":"paragraph","text":" Phillip Coulson : Colleague and team leader","elements":[]},{"id":14829,"type":"paragraph","text":" Melinda May : Colleague","elements":[]},{"id":14830,"type":"paragraph","text":" Grant Ward : Friend and Colleague","elements":[]},{"id":14831,"type":"paragraph","text":" Skye : Friend and colleague","elements":[]},{"id":14832,"type":"paragraph","text":" Michael Peterson : Colleague","elements":[]}],"images":[]},{"id":9882,"title":"Etymology","level":2,"content":[{"id":14833,"type":"list","text":null,"elements":[{"id":323,"text":"Jemma - \u0022Jewel\u0022 in Italian, \u0022Little Dove\u0022 in Hebrew."},{"id":324,"text":"Simmons - patronymic surname derived from the ancient HebrewShimon, means \u0022to hearken\u0022."}]}],"images":[]},{"id":9883,"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"id":14834,"type":"list","text":null,"elements":[{"id":325,"text":"Her current ID badge serial number isA 0956307; the card was issued on 5 February 2013, and will expire on 5 February 2018."},{"id":326,"text":"As of \u0022 FZZT \u0022, both her parents are still alive."},{"id":327,"text":"As seen in \u0022 The Hub \u0022, her birthday is 11 September 1987.

He was aboard Director Fury\u0027s Helicarrier, and was assigned to guard the prisoner when the vessel came under attack. He was carrying a prototype weapon, a S.H.I.E.L.D. design directly consequent to the encounter with Thor and Loki a year earlier. Loki used his powers of illusion to make himself appear to be at the control panel for the cage, then skewered Coulson from behind with a Chitauri sceptre. After he sent his step-brother plummeting earthward confined in the cage, the mischief-maker turned his attention back to the dying agent and his final words, beginning with \u0022You\u0027re gonna lose.\u0022 Coulson proceeded to demonstrate Loki\u0027s \u0027lack of conviction\u0027 but putting his last reserves of energy into discharging his weapon at the god. Coulson\u0027s action kept Loki from taking full advantage of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u0027s disarray, and the Asgardian made his escape with his cohorts. Director Fury found the last vestiges of life in his friend, but they were already slipping away. Coulson\u0027s final words were, \u0022This was never gonna work if they didn\u0027t have something to ...\u0022 The concept may have inspired Fury to \u0027mislead\u0027 Captain America and Tony Stark into believing that Coulson had, in his final moments, been carrying his \u0027Captain America\u0027 card collection, looking to get Steve Rogers\u0027 signature.","elements":[]},{"id":15087,"type":"paragraph","text":" Technically speaking, Fury doesn\u0027t say at the scene that Coulson is dead in so many words.

Speaking to Maria Hill concerning the deception of the cards, Fury\u0027s justification is \u0022They needed the push.\u0022 This suggests there would be no automatic limits to how far he would go to motivate the Avengers.

She and Fitz set up comms in an unused room and start discussing the package on board. Skye wonders if it could be an 0-8-4, but Fitz says no, since they know the origin of the package is Cybertek. Skye then asks if an 0-8-4 could be a human. With this question, Skye reveals her hope that there might be another alien out there on Earth like her. She might not be alone.

Skye asks Fitz if an 0-8-4 could be a human, to which he responds it\u0027s possible, but he\u0027d hate to meet the guy. Communications go down and a guard bursts into the room just as Skye and Fitz go to warn the others. They fight off the attacker, but Simmons rushes in just as the man pulls out a toxin grenade. It goes off between them, freezing them both and Fitz and Skye arrange Simmons into a more comfortable position for when she wakes up. Fitz hits the man with a couple more shots of the Night-Night Gun and places it in Simmons\u0027 hand with a new round inside. Skye remarks that the grenade\u0027s toxin looked a lot like the Night-Night Gun\u0027s and Fitz replies that it is, but more evolved.

His team busts in on a meeting being held with a man called Vanchat. The guy tries and fails to escape their pursuit. Victoria Hand lets the captive know that they need his help finding a friend. They want him to lead them to Centipede . Once that happens, they\u2019ll find Coulson. Regarding the other casualty of the kidnapping, agent-in-training Michael Peterson appears to have died in the explosion. Skye wants to hack into Vanchat\u2019s financials, but Hand wants her booted off the bus. May agrees with this decision. With a little nudge from Ward , Fitz , and Simmons , Skye sets off to investigate things on her own. She poses as Agent Melinda May to get information on Vanchat\u2019s financials.","elements":[]},{"id":15495,"type":"paragraph","text":" Back on the bus, Ward tricks Agent Hand\u2019s interrogator so he can apply his own intense brand of questioning to Vanchat. He gets results that lead to active strikes all over the world. Agent Hand can\u2019t help but wonder why Agent Coulson is so important. Coulson lets Po know that he\u2019ll die before giving any information. He says that the Clairvoyant is a fraud. Po disagrees, but he does admit that his friend can\u2019t see how Coulson was brought back from the dead. Po will torture him until he finds the answer to this. Coulson manages to escape from his bindings, but he\u2019s trapped in a forgotten town that\u2019s surrounded by nothing but desert. Po continues his torture until a phone call from the Clairvoyant puts an end to it. It also puts an end to Po, as he\u2019s killed via a remote death blow. Raina is asked to take over where Po left off with Coulson. She wants to know how the super soldiers they are creating can be brought back to life. She offers to help uncover the secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has been keeping. Raina brings up the past love of Coulson\u2019s life. Her heart was broken when S.H.I.E.L.D. told her he was dead. Coulson realizes that he keeps saying that Tahiti is a magical place. He tells Raina to turn on her machine so he can finally find out why. Ward is caught off guard when he realizes May got Skye kicked off the bus so she\u2019d have more freedom to do her thing.

Elsewhere in a Norway national park, a couple follows directions to a mysterious tree, chopping it down to find an Asgardian staff that grants the woman rage-filed strength by touching it, which she then uses on a park ranger. Later at the scene, Ward helps Simmons through her reticence to investigate the downed tree, using her tech to create a 3D model of the staff for Fitz to print out. The analysis reveals the artifact as Asgardian, while Skye sees over the news that the couple, Petra Larsen and her boyfriend Jakob, have been connected to several ongoing Norway riots as part of a Norse hate group.
